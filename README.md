# My NeoVim config

This is my NeoVim setup for my Web Development work.

It is based on the tutorial by [lsp-zero](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/docs/tutorial)

The plugin manager is [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/)

## How to set up

1. Clone this repo to `~/.config/nvim/`.

2. Make sure that the npm packages `typescript`, `typescript-language-server`, and `vscode-langservers-extracted` are installed.

   - I use `nvm` to manage node and the global npm packages. So, running `nvm install --lts` installs all of these packages for me.

3. Install NeoVim.

5. Launch NeoVim. It should install all the necessary plugins.
