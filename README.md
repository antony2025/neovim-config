# My NeoVim config

This is my NeoVim setup for my Web Development work.

It is based on the video and repo by `ThePrimeagen`:

1.  [The Video](https://youtu.be/w7i4amO_zaE)
2.  [The repo](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua)

It uses [lsp-zero](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/lsp-zero.nvim), which makes it super easy to
set up LSP.
